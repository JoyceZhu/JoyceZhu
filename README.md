Hi, Iâ€™m @JoyceZhu. I currently work as the TL of the accessibility team at [@quip](https://github.com/quip).

You can also find a personal site, my dotfiles (and other things I want to stash in a VCS),
tinkering with mechanical keyboards, and some of my previous work interning at [@edx](https://github.com/edx) in my repos.
